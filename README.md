# Design Pattern Studies
This repository is a review of some commonly used design patterns for study purposes and quick reference.
Examples of each pattern in several languages can be found in this repository folders and also in the wiki a short explanation and discussion about each pattern can be found.
Not only Object Oriented approaches on those patterns can be found but also, whenever suitable, some functional approaches too.
